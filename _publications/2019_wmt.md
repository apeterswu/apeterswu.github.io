<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
We  Microsoft  Research  Asia  made  submis-sions to 11 language directions in the WMT19news  translation  tasks.We  won  the  firstplace  for  8  of  the  11  directions  and  the  sec-ond place for the other three.  Our basic sys-tems  are  built  on  Transformer,  back  transla-tion and knowledge distillation.  We integrateseveral of our rececent techniques to enhancethe baseline systems:  multi-agent dual learn-ing  (MADL),  masked  sequence-to-sequencepre-training (MASS), neural architecture opti-mization (NAO), and soft contextual data aug-mentation (SCA)
