About me
------
I am Lijun Wu, currently a research of [Machine Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) in [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/). I previously got Ph.D. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm), a member of [joint Ph.D. program](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/connections/academic-programs/joint-phd) between SYSU and MSRA. Advised by [Dr. Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) and [Prof. Jianhuang Lai](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2498). 

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, sequence-to-seqeunce learning tasks such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Summarization. I am also interested in meta-learning, general Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Feel free and welcome to contact me!
