About me
------
<strong>Keep Learning & Positive!</strong>
Lijun Wu is currently a Senior Researcher of [Machine Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) in [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/). He got the Ph.D. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm), [School of Data and Computer Science](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2020, was a member of [joint Ph.D. program](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/connections/academic-programs/joint-phd) between SYSU and MSRA, advised by [Dr. Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) and [Prof. Jianhuang Lai](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2498). He received [MSRA Ph.D. Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/#!fellows) in 2018. Prior to that, he obtained the Bachelor degree in the same department in 2015. 

His researches focus on Deep Learning, NLP, Multimodality Learning, Medical Health, Bio-NLP, Bio-Embedding, Drug Discovery. Works during the Ph.D. journey are mostly on sequence learning tasks such as neural machine translation. He is also interested in meta learning, reinforcement learning.
