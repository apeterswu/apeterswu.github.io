About me
------
I am Lijun Wu, currently a researcher of [Machine Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) in [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/). I got my Ph.D. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm), [School of Data and Computer Science](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2020, was a member of [joint Ph.D. program](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/connections/academic-programs/joint-phd) between SYSU and MSRA, advised by [Dr. Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) and [Prof. Jianhuang Lai](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2498). Prior to that, I obtained the Bachelor degree in the same department in 2015. 

My researches focus on Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Multimodality Learning, Medical Health. Works during my Ph.D. journey are mostly on sequence learning tasks such as neural machine translation. I am also interested in meta learning, reinforcement learning.
